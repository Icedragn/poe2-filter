# PoE2 Filter Base
General bare-bones filter base for PoE2, edit to your own liking and enjoy!

Current version: 0.1.3

Filter features:
- Highlights based on NeverSink's Azurite theme
- Basic currency and item tiering
- Socketed items for salvaging
- Separated highlighting for all item types, easily configurable to fit your goals
- Basic item tier highlighting for all item bases (expert, advanced, normal)

Filter TODOs:
- Tiered drop highlighting (not functionally available yet to my knowledge)
- Advanced item tiering for armour, weapons and jewellery
- Item tiering for uniques
- Base highlighting sections (?)
- Stacked currency highlighting
- Levelling sections (including optional custom sounds akin to PoE1 levelling filters)

If you have any questions or issues please reach out to me on Discord (icedragn)
